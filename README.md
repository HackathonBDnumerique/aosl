AOSL: Digital Media Story-Telling Format

**AOSL is a data format to express digital stories**. 
It's based on XML for inter-operability (to help building tools around it) and it can be used either for:

 - direct use: reading and edition of digital media stories directly by interpreting an AOSL file;
 - export: convert the AOSL information to a more efficient format for the target interpreter;
 - create a new file format: you can create new format files including AOSL code to help describing a digital story;

It's not explicitly designed to be read by humans as it's mainly targetted at helping tools to represent and process a digital story. It's media-agnostic and interpreter-agnostic.
